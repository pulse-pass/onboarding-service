# Tests

- Unit tests (JUnit 5 + Mockito + AssertJ) in `src/test/java/.../unit/`, mirroring the main packages: **one test class per production class**, never grouping several classes in one test.
- Test names `method_scenario_expectedResult`.
- Black-box integration tests with REST Assured against the service running in Docker Compose (no Testcontainers), in `src/test/java/.../integration/`: `BaseIntegrationTest` (URL, port and token from environment variables) and one class per route `Test<Method><Action>` (e.g. `TestPostCreateOrganization`). They run with `./mvnw test -Pintegration`; `./mvnw test` runs only the unit tests.
- Integration test classes have no constants other than the route URL (e.g. `private static final String POST_LEGAL_PERSONS = "/onboarding/legal_persons";`) and no helper methods of any visibility: each test declares its own data (names, documents, tokens), builds its own payload, makes its own call (REST Assured) and writes its own assertions inline, even when that repeats code across tests. Stateless tools (`JsonMapper`) are fine as instance fields, and `BaseIntegrationTest` keeps its shared constants and fields (URL, port, tokens). Unit tests may keep constants, `@BeforeEach` setup and private helpers.
- Shared test helpers (`SetupTools`, `DocumentGenerators`, `MockServerHandlers`) live in `src/test/java/.../common/` and are the only reusable test code. `SetupTools` only creates prerequisites for **other** scopes (e.g. creating an organization to test the GET route); it does not hold payload builders.
- REST Assured must be 6.x: Spring Boot 4 brings Groovy 5 and Jackson 3, which REST Assured 5.x cannot use.
- Integration tests are always run against the real compose (`./infrastructure/service-start.sh test` + `./mvnw test -Pintegration`) before a task is closed; unit tests with mocks do not catch persistence problems (lazy loading, constraints, schema validation).
- Each test generates its own data (UUIDs, random valid CNPJ); no teardown.
- Every route has success and error tests; a 409 on duplicates proves the write when there is no GET route yet.
